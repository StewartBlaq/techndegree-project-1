      <h3>United States Air Force</h3>
      <p>For over five years I spent my time in the military acquiring valuable skills that are usefull for not just technical driven tasks, but also for day-to-day life.
      One very important skillset I sharpened was the ability to create and maintain structure. Whether it was for strategically scheduling system-wide inspections,
    prioritizing fault troubleshooting, or simply keeping my workspace organized--structure was key. The flightline is very fast paced, thus keeping to deadlines was
  a necessity.I believe my ability to heed the time constraints for projects/assignments is a valuable skill that any company could benefit from.</p>

      <h3>ICON Park</h3>
      <p>'The Giant Wheel' at ICON Park took my "climing to the sky" claim and made it literal. For five years I spent my time climbing the 400ft structure inorder to accomplish routine inspections,
      network & electrical system troubleshooting, plus a handful of mechanical work. This position highlights my ability to adapt and overcome challenges. Personally I am afraid of heights, but
    I pushed past that fear so that I could get the job properly done. At the start of my employment here is when I enrolled full-time in college for my Bachelor's in Science. I was been able to
  maintain a >3.5GPA while still carrying out my workplace duties.</p>
